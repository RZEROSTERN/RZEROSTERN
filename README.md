## :wave: Welcome to the roughnecks, STERNIE'S ROUGHNECKS !!!

Hi! I'm Marco Ram√≠rez and I :heart: programming, beer :beer: and videogames :video_game:.

Right now I'm interested with mobile aplications in Android and/or Flutter. But that doesn't means those are my unique skills, having also skills with frontend and backend in web and a little bit of server configurations.
